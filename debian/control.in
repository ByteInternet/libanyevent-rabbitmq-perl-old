Description: asynchronous and multi channel Perl AMQP client
 AnyEvent::RabbitMQ is an AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol)
 client library, that is intended to allow you to interact with
 AMQP-compliant message brokers/servers such as RabbitMQ in an
 asynchronous fashion.
 .
 You can use AnyEvent::RabbitMQ to -
 .
  * Declare and delete exchanges
  * Declare, delete, bind and unbind queues
  * Set QoS and confirm mode
  * Publish, consume, get, ack, recover and reject messages
  * Select, commit and rollback transactions
 .
 AnyEvent::RabbitMQ is known to work with RabbitMQ versions 2.5.1 and
 versions 0-8 and 0-9-1 of the AMQP specification.
 .
 This client is the non-blocking version, for a blocking version with a
 similar API, see Net::RabbitFoot.
